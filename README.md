Basic iOS playlist browser to practice key fundamental concepts in Swift

This project is a basic playlist browser I developed in XCode in order to get a better grasp of Swift. The iOS app is very simple in design, allowing a user to navigate through six playlists with hard-coded playlist information stored in the app. The purpose of this project was simply to get practice working with Interface Builder and XCode, and I look forward to using the skills and experiences developed during this project to build more exciting and complex iOS applications.
